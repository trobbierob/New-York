    <string name="tipsy_description">My Italian ancestors brought ice cream to Scotland in the 1800s. First up – my great, great, great grandfather, Achille, who moved from his small mountaintop town of Picinisco, Italy to Glasgow, Scotland. He made ice cream at home and sold it from a pushcart as he walked the city streets. Eventually he opened his own ice cream shop and brought his sons into the business. The family business continued with my great, great grandfather, Giovanni, who opened several of his own shops around Glasgow in the 1900s. My great grandfather, Federico, continued the family ice cream tradition and opened shops throughout Scotland and England and eventually became the President of the Ice Cream Alliance of Great Britain.\n\nFollowing in the ice cream tradition, I began to experiment with putting a modern boozy twist on ice cream. I wanted to combine the best of both worlds and infuse traditional ice cream ﬂavors with diﬀerent liquors. I ﬁnally perfected the recipes and came up with creamy, tipsy and delicious treats!</string>

    <string name="spot_dessert_description">specializes in seasonal dessert tapas that are more than just sweet, but leverage combinations of flavors that are also light and refreshing. Our dishes are comforting but our flavors are serious.  We take Eastern and Western influences, balancing unique ingredients such as Green Tea, Kabocha, and Yuzu to create one of a kind confections. Designed with harmony in mind, the true potential of each dish is revealed when shared and tasted with the other desserts. Spot is not your average dessert bar; we are putting a new “spin” on swe­­et. \n- Story of the Founders : Chai &amp; Ace\n\n In 2009, cousins Chatchai “Chai” Huadwattanana and Ace Watanasuparp formed Chace Restaurant Group (CRG). From an early age, Chai has been surrounded and influenced by corner stones of Thai Cuisine like Bangkok’s famed Wat Sai Floating Market. This led Chai to explore Thailand’s culinary depths, learning authentic Thai cooking from the exclusive Thai Temple. Like his cousin, Ace developed deep roots in culinary from the ever-evolving NYC restaurant scene. Ace learned the ins and outs of the restaurant business by working at several of his parents restaurants with tasks ranging from cooking to waiting tables. Chace Restaurant Group brings together decades of restaurant and cooking experience that is rooted in a philosophy emphasizing tradition and innovation.\n\n- Spot Dessert Bar was CRG’s first restaurant, opening on November of 2009 in St. Marks. CRG partnered with the Iron Chef of Thailand, Chef Ian Kittichai, to create a unique menu that boasts an array of never before seen tapas desserts.Spot is the medium in which Chef Ian shares his global experiences through confectionery creations.  Whether it is a signature dish like the “Green Tea Lava” or the “Golden Toast”, or a seasonal creation such as the “Mango Crepe Soufflé”, tasting each dish takes you to a different part of the world. Upon the success of SPOT, CRG launched SPOT’s 2nd location in Korea Town NYC on October 2012 &amp; 3rd location "The Shoppe" on December 2014.\n\n- In 2009, CRG introduced New Yorkers to OBAO, blending traditional dishes from Vietnam and Thailand.  With three locations (Midtown, Water Street, and Hell’s Kicthen), OBAO has established itself as a staple in the New York City restaurant scene and is on the forefront of Asian culinary innovation. With plans to franchise SPOT Dessert Bar globally, Chace Restaurant Group’s story has just begun. The question is no longer whether or not CRG will make its mark in the culinary industry, but how big their mark will be.</string>

    <string name="levain_bakery_description">Nestled in New York City’s Upper West Side, Levain headquarters is a cozy neighborhood bakery where locals are greeted by name. A steady stream of loyal regulars stand side by side with tourists, eager to sample the legendary baked goods.\n\nFrom an inventive array of rustic breads to the world-famous six-ounce chocolate chip walnut cookie, everything is baked on-site, fresh every day from the finest natural ingredients. What doesn’t sell that day goes to help feed the hungry—a mission that has been solidly in place since the beginning.\n\nThe bakery was founded in 1994 by friends Connie McDonald and Pam Weekes. At the time, Connie was in banking and Pam in Fashion. The two, both competitive swimmers, trained together for the Ironman and—not surprisingly, as their tireless workouts left them feeling starved for great food— they began a passionate dialog about creating the world’s greatest chocolate chip cookie.\n\nWithin just a few years, Levain Bakery had become a neighborhood institution and a destination for epicurious travelers from around the world. Demand continued to grow. In 2000, to satisfy their regular clientele summering in the Hamptons, the two opened a second bakery in the village of Wainscott on Long Island’s East End. And today, through their website, they now ship their world-famous cookies to happy fans around the globe.</string>

Chef Ansel also spent seven years at the venerable French bakery Fauchon, where he was in charge of international expansion. He has helped Fauchon set up shops around the world, including Russia, Egypt, and Kuwait.\n\nThese days, the chef is often noted for his support of various charities, including the fight to end hunger with Food Bank for New York City. In 2013, he appeared on the CNN’s Nightly News to launch a series of charitable campaigns that increased Food Bank search engine awareness by 56% and raised more than $10K of proceeds. Growing up in a poor family in the north of France, the Chef’s story and passion for food and desire to turn that passion for good has inspired a personal visit from the First Lady of France and a call from President François Hollande himself.</string>
